# So You Want to Learn to Program?

SYWtLtP is a primer for people who want to learn more about programming. Not to be confused with a tutorial, SYWtLtP is largely conceptual and describes programming itself rather than any particular language, library, or framework. It hinges around the metaphor of a world or a map that beginners can use to gain a sense of place in the programming world while gradually filling in their knowledge in any given programming discipline.
