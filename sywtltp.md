# So you want to learn to program?

My name is Brian Kung. I'm a developer, mostly self-taught, and I'm extremely passionate about helping people learn to program. Throughout high school and college, I avoided programming because I thought I wasn't smart enough for it, or because I thought it was the same thing as my high school job, fixing computers (Information Technology), which I hated. It wasn't until I graduated from college that I discovered that I had the capability to learn programming. Within a year of deciding to learn to program, I had landed a job at the Chicago Sun-Times as a Ruby on Rails web developer.

I'm not going to assume that you want to program professionally. Maybe you just need it for one project. Or maybe you just needed in order to be able to communicate with people more technical than yourself. Whatever it is you need to learn programming for, it's helpful to know the lay of the land, which is what I'm here for. As someone relatively new to the field of programming, I know what it's like to start learning, but as someone a bit further along the way, I can help point you in the right direction and give you tips and warnings that are particularly relevant to your journey.

It's an increasingly important journey to take. Software is [eating the world][software.nom(world)] - software runs everything from your phone to your electric blender. And while nobody is going to understand all the code being executed around them, understanding just a small corner of that world is a major win. It won't demystify all of software, but it should give you the confidence that you, too, can make sense of it. Like anything else, it's a matter of persistence.

There's an intensive programming bootcamp called [Dev Bootcamp][dbc] whose motto is "Coding is the new literacy." I don't think programming skills in any way replace literacy, but I do think there are strong parallels between the commoditization of literacy and the increased interest in programming. While it may not replace literature, code is certainly a new _kind_ of literacy. And just as learning to read and write is incredibly beneficial to one's personal growth and effectiveness in society, learning to program also has significant benefits.

By way of example, my friend Sam recently took over someone else's role in her company. Leading up to the changeover, Sam was worried about dealing with the new 70+ hour a week workload. However, I checked in with Sam a week or so after the change had taken place, and he said it was no problem. The job that had taken the other employee 70+ hours a week took less than 30. Sam had managed to automate most of the job away and more than doubled her coworker's efficiency. Automation is probably the most useful programming concept for day to day life.

Again, this is not an in-depth guide on how to program. Instead, it's intended to paint a picture of what programming is. It's a lantern in the dark for all the people peering into this new world, curious, afraid, or both.

Come on, it's a big place. There's a lot to explore!

## The World of Programming

I often refer to programming as a world in and of itself because the analogy captures the fear of the unknown, the excitement of exploration, and the vastness of the territories involved. I wish someone had told me in the beginning that learning to program is like learning to navigate in that world.

As a child, it's not until you gather up the courage to open the door to the outside world that you begin to see the boundaries between your yard and the neighbor's yard, between the yard and the street. And for many suburban youths, the concept of how streets fit together to connect the various places in our lives doesn't begin to click until they begin to drive. There's so much to learn: street signs, local roads versus highways, county, state, and international borders. For a child just beginning to explore her own yard, international travel is just an abstract idea.

Similarly, beginners in programming know neither up nor down. They may have heard of a programming language or two, but without sufficient context, they have little understanding of what those languages actually are, or what they're good for, or what "good" is.

This is a flawed metaphor, as all metaphors ultimately are, but I like to think of the world of programming as being composed of the various industries or specialties that involve programming. A few you may have heard of are games, websites, desktop applications, and mobile apps. A few you may not have heard of include natural language processing, embedded systems, data visualization, and artificial intelligence.

Just like real geographies, the borders we draw between them are fuzzy at best. For instance, there are both internet games, mobile games, and desktop application games. But imagine for a moment that each is its own little city, mountain, or forest, and together they form the world of programming. Each one has its own peculiarities, like popular languages, landmarks, cultures, and communities. _Especially_ cultures and communities, in a literal sense. As you learn more about the world of programming, you may find that it is often the people you meet that are the most important aspects of programming.

It's also useful to think about programming as a geography because expertise in programming has both breadth and depth, like geography. That is, your knowledge of Chicago is not very useful when you're in New York (breadth), and chances are, no matter how well you know Chicago, someone will know it better than you, even if it's just their neighborhood (depth). There's a lot of things to learn a lot about, but that's no reason to be afraid. Learning how to navigate means finding a few tools or methods that will help you figure out how to get from point A to point B regardless of whether you've been to either place before.

Granted, it is a big place. The immensity of it all can be overwhelming, even to experienced programmers. Feeling fear or confusion is a normal reaction. But unlike real physical travel, most journeys in programming take place primarily in your own mind. You can always go back to somewhere familiar as easily as thinking of something else.

That said, there's a lot of opportunities to explore, learn, and gain new perspectives in the world of programming. So stick around - we're just getting started!
